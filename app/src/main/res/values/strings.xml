        Epomis beetles are often metallic blue or green colored,
        with a striking yellow-orange rim on the elytra and mostly yellow-colored legs and antennae.
        \n\n
        They are 15–26 millimetres (0.59–1.02 in) in length.
        \n\n
        They can be distinguished from the closely related genus Chlaenius by the short (less than three times as long as wide)
        and triangular labial palps.
        \n\n
        The larvae reach a body length of up to 20 millimetres (0.79 in),
        they are white or yellow colored, with black and orange markings.
        \n\n
        Like many ground beetle larvae they are elongated with two extensions (Urogomphi) at the rear end.
        \n\n
        They have characteristic double-hooked mandibles.
        \n\n
        Larvae of the two European species can be distinguished by their color pattern.
